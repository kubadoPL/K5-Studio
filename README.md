Hello, I'm Jakub, a student at the University of Łódź. I'm a self-taught programmer, graphic designer, and 3D artist. My journey into all of that started at 14, driven by a passion for creating games. Currently studying computer science at the Faculty of Economics and Sociology, I know programming languages such as Lua, C#, VBA, Python, and a bit of PHP. In the realm of 3D art, I use Blender 3D, and for 2D work Adobe Photoshop. I acquired these skills purely out of passion and now aim to share my work with the world! I invite you to explore my portfolio and I hope to work for you soon!
